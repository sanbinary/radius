The recommendations page displays movies and TV shows that are recommended to the user based on their viewing history. The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering to identify similar users and suggest movies and TV shows that they have enjoyed. Users can add recommended content to their watchlist and rate the content that they have already watched.

### Collaborative Filtering

The recommendation system on this website uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history. The system analyzes the viewing patterns of all users on the website and identifies movies that are commonly watched together. It then recommends movies to users based on their viewing history and the viewing history of users with similar interests.
